Plain-text copy for the 81 emails (27 segments x 3). Merge fields use `{{double braces}}`. Each segment's wording is built from that page's own approved copy (its "where clients usually get stuck" points), so it stays consistent with the website.

## How these were written (best practices applied)

Principles drawn from four sources: [Success Knocks](https://successknocks.com/b2b-follow-up-email-templates/), [Artemis Leads](https://www.artemisleads.com/resources-outbound-lead-generation/ultimate-guide-to-follow-up-email-sequences-for-b2b), [Peer to Peer Marketing](https://peertopeermarketing.co/b2b-email-marketing-best-practices/) and [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/b2b-email-marketing-examples). Several of their statistics are unsourced and MailerLite is a vendor, so the rules below are the practices they agree on, not their numbers.

| Principle | How it shows up here |
|---|---|
| Keep it to 3 or 4 touches; more raises unsubscribes and spam complaints | 3 emails per series |
| Space follow-ups 2 to 3 days apart, then a longer gap; give the reader a day or two after a download | Day 0, day 3, day 7 |
| Every email adds something new, never "just checking in" | E1 delivers and sets up, E2 gives one self-check question, E3 gives a time-and-cost angle and closes |
| One clear call to action per email, easy to say yes to | E1 download, E2 reply with one specific thing, E3 book a time |
| Short, skimmable, mobile friendly | roughly 75 to 100 words each (counts below), one idea per paragraph, single column |
| Personalize beyond the first name: company, industry, the problem | The first name in every email; the company name in Emails 2 and 3 only, so it never feels like a mail merge; the segment's own scenario and pain point throughout |
| Short, specific subject lines (about 40 characters so they show on mobile) | about 25 to 50 characters; lowercase and personal, like a note from a colleague; no "free", no exclamation marks |
| Align preview text with the subject | Every email has preview text |
| Breakup email with easy exits ("wrong person", "wrong timing") | E3 and its P.S. |
| Lead with value and education, a conversational but professional tone | Casual, expert voice: it opens with a scene the reader recognises, then shows we know where it goes wrong; the sale is a low-pressure offer |
| Segment by industry and lead source | A separate series per service and industry |
| Permission-based, with an unsubscribe route | Footer line: reply "stop"; honor opt-outs in Zoho |

## Voice and formatting

- **Sounds like a person who has seen this before.** Each series opens with a relatable scene from that segment ("the invoice says one thing, the permit says another..."), asks a question the reader can answer in their head, then shows the expert answer. That is what keeps people reading and gives them a reason to reply.
- **Casual on purpose.** Short sentences, ellipses for a beat of curiosity, "um... probably?", "promise", "no pitch deck, no pressure". Lowercase subject lines and preview text look like a colleague's message, not a campaign.
- **Name always, company sometimes.** The first name is in every subject, greeting and sign-off context; the company appears in Emails 2 and 3 where it reads naturally.
- **No real small caps or special characters.** Unicode "small caps" letters are read out as gibberish by screen readers and can trip spam filters, so lowercase gives the same casual look safely.
- **Honest claims only.** No statistics, no invented client results, no urgency that is not real. The only facts are the checklist itself and each page's own "where clients usually get stuck" points.

**Rotated wording.** To stop every series sounding the same, the subject lines, preview text, opening lines and one connecting sentence rotate through a set of variants (8 for Email 1, 10 for Email 2, 6 for Email 3), assigned so neighbouring segments never match. The variant set lives in `tools/email_variants.json`; add or edit variants there. Each variant is still written to the rules above.

## Sequence blueprint

| Email | Send | Job | Single CTA |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediately | Deliver the checklist, name the three pitfalls, make a human offer | Download the checklist |
| 2 | Day 3 | One self-check question tied to the biggest pitfall, and why it matters | Reply with one specific item |
| 3 | Day 7 | Different angle (cost of finding out late), clear close, easy exits | Book a time |

Send Tuesday to Thursday, mornings in Manila time where the tool allows. The series stops automatically when the lead's status is no longer "Not Contacted" or they opt out.

## Merge fields

`{{first_name}}` and `{{company}}` come from the form (fall back to "there" and "your team" if blank). `{{first_name_lc}}` is the first name in lowercase, for the lowercase subject lines. `{{sender_name}}` is a real person's name, ideally the sender, because replies to a named person perform better than to a team address. Links: `[Download the checklist]` is the segment's Google Drive download link (all 27 are listed in docs/AUTOMATION-HANDOFF.md); `[Book a time]` is `https://themillsglobal.com/book-a-call.html`.

## Design

The HTML shell (brand colors with accessible contrast, dark-mode safe, single column) is in `tools/email-builder.js`. Its built-in wording is an earlier draft and is superseded by the copy below; drop this copy into the shell. Navy `#212431` text and buttons on white, slate `#4F5D75` for secondary text, orange `#EA5C1F` only as decoration (it fails the contrast minimum for text).
