# Email sequences: all 27 services and industries

Plain-text copy for the 81 emails (27 segments x 3). Merge fields use `{{double braces}}`. Each segment's wording is built from that page's own approved copy (its "where clients usually get stuck" points), so it stays consistent with the website.

## How these were written (best practices applied)

Principles drawn from four sources: [Success Knocks](https://successknocks.com/b2b-follow-up-email-templates/), [Artemis Leads](https://www.artemisleads.com/resources-outbound-lead-generation/ultimate-guide-to-follow-up-email-sequences-for-b2b), [Peer to Peer Marketing](https://peertopeermarketing.co/b2b-email-marketing-best-practices/) and [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/blog/b2b-email-marketing-examples). Several of their statistics are unsourced and MailerLite is a vendor, so the rules below are the practices they agree on, not their numbers.

| Principle | How it shows up here |
|---|---|
| Keep it to 3 or 4 touches; more raises unsubscribes and spam complaints | 3 emails per series |
| Space follow-ups 2 to 3 days apart, then a longer gap; give the reader a day or two after a download | Day 0, day 3, day 7 |
| Every email adds something new, never "just checking in" | E1 delivers and sets up, E2 gives one self-check question, E3 gives a time-and-cost angle and closes |
| One clear call to action per email, easy to say yes to | E1 download, E2 reply with one specific thing, E3 book a time |
| Short, skimmable, mobile friendly | roughly 75 to 100 words each (counts below), one idea per paragraph, single column |
| Personalize beyond the first name: company, industry, the problem | The first name in every email; the company name in Emails 2 and 3 only, so it never feels like a mail merge; the segment's own scenario and pain point throughout |
| Short, specific subject lines (about 40 characters so they show on mobile) | about 25 to 50 characters; lowercase and personal, like a note from a colleague; no "free", no exclamation marks |
| Align preview text with the subject | Every email has preview text |
| Breakup email with easy exits ("wrong person", "wrong timing") | E3 and its P.S. |
| Lead with value and education, a conversational but professional tone | Casual, expert voice: it opens with a scene the reader recognises, then shows we know where it goes wrong; the sale is a low-pressure offer |
| Segment by industry and lead source | A separate series per service and industry |
| Permission-based, with an unsubscribe route | Footer line: reply "stop"; honor opt-outs in Zoho |

## Voice and formatting

- **Sounds like a person who has seen this before.** Each series opens with a relatable scene from that segment ("the invoice says one thing, the permit says another..."), asks a question the reader can answer in their head, then shows the expert answer. That is what keeps people reading and gives them a reason to reply.
- **Casual on purpose.** Short sentences, ellipses for a beat of curiosity, "um... probably?", "promise", "no pitch deck, no pressure". Lowercase subject lines and preview text look like a colleague's message, not a campaign.
- **Name always, company sometimes.** The first name is in every subject, greeting and sign-off context; the company appears in Emails 2 and 3 where it reads naturally.
- **No real small caps or special characters.** Unicode "small caps" letters are read out as gibberish by screen readers and can trip spam filters, so lowercase gives the same casual look safely.
- **Honest claims only.** No statistics, no invented client results, no urgency that is not real. The only facts are the checklist itself and each page's own "where clients usually get stuck" points.

**Rotated wording.** To stop every series sounding the same, the subject lines, preview text, opening lines and one connecting sentence rotate through a set of variants (8 for Email 1, 10 for Email 2, 6 for Email 3), assigned so neighbouring segments never match. The variant set lives in `tools/email_variants.json`; add or edit variants there. Each variant is still written to the rules above.

## Sequence blueprint

| Email | Send | Job | Single CTA |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Immediately | Deliver the checklist, name the three pitfalls, make a human offer | Download the checklist |
| 2 | Day 3 | One self-check question tied to the biggest pitfall, and why it matters | Reply with one specific item |
| 3 | Day 7 | Different angle (cost of finding out late), clear close, easy exits | Book a time |

Send Tuesday to Thursday, mornings in Manila time where the tool allows. The series stops automatically when the lead's status is no longer "Not Contacted" or they opt out.

## Merge fields

`{{first_name}}` and `{{company}}` come from the form (fall back to "there" and "your team" if blank). `{{first_name_lc}}` is the first name in lowercase, for the lowercase subject lines. `{{sender_name}}` is a real person's name, ideally the sender, because replies to a named person perform better than to a team address. Links: `[Download the checklist]` is the segment's Google Drive download link (all 27 are listed in docs/AUTOMATION-HANDOFF.md); `[Book a time]` is `https://themillsglobal.com/book-a-call.html`.

## Design

The HTML shell (brand colors with accessible contrast, dark-mode safe, single column) is in `tools/email-builder.js`. Its built-in wording is an earlier draft and is superseded by the copy below; drop this copy into the shell. Navy `#212431` text and buttons on white, slate `#4F5D75` for secondary text, orange `#EA5C1F` only as decoration (it fails the contrast minimum for text).

Hi {{first_name}},

Buying stock before the company setup is even sorted... sound familiar?

That is exactly what this checklist is for. Here it is:

[Download the checklist]

Three things to check first:

1. Buying before the structure is ready
2. Registrations in the wrong order
3. A first shipment that becomes a test

Skim it with your own shipment in mind. If something looks off, hit reply and send me the product you plan to bring in and where you plan to sell it. I will tell you what I would check first.

Hi {{first_name}},

Honest question...

Is your company structure settled, and are your registrations in the right order, before the first purchase order goes out?

If your honest answer is "um... probably?", that is the part of Philippine market entry where things tend to go sideways.

Here is why it matters: Companies order stock before deciding who the importer of record is or which registrations apply.

Finding out which agency you needed after the cargo is already booked... sound familiar?

So we put together a checklist for exactly that. Here you go:

[Download the checklist]

Three things to check first:

1. Not knowing which agency applies
2. Approvals that arrive too late

Hi {{first_name}},

Can I ask you something?

Do you know which agency approves your product, and does that approval describe the goods exactly as they will be shipped?

If you had to think about it, that is usually where import permits starts to wobble.

Here is why it matters: The same product can touch several regulators, and its commercial name rarely tells you which.

Not sure about {{company}}? Reply with the product name and description and I will tell you where I would look first.

Do your invoice, packing list and permits all describe the goods in exactly the same way?

A "hmm, not sure" is common here. It is also where customs clearance tends to get stuck.

Here is why it matters: Invoices, packing lists and permits that disagree with each other are a common reason cargo is queried.

Hi {{first_name}},

Here is the one I always start with...

Has someone confirmed that every piece of the cargo can actually travel the planned route, from port to site?

If your honest answer is "um... probably?", that is the part of project cargo where things tend to go sideways.

Here is why it matters: A permit, route restriction or lifting limit discovered late can delay an entire project.

Is it clear which agencies are involved for the vessel or equipment before it is bought or shipped?

If you had to think about it, that is usually where vessel and marine equipment starts to wobble.

Has the cargo been identified as dangerous goods before it was booked with the carrier?

A "hmm, not sure" is common here. It is also where dangerous goods shipping tends to get stuck.

Hi {{first_name}},

Honest question...

Which decisions have you already made that depend on rules you have not yet mapped?

If you had to think about it, that is usually where Philippine trade compliance starts to wobble.

Here is why it matters: Management knows a transaction needs regulatory clearance but not which agencies apply, in what order, or how customs fits in.

Hi {{first_name}},

Parting thought, then I am out of your inbox.

Here is the thing about manufacturing equipment imports... it is usually much easier to sort out before the cargo moves than after it is sitting at the port.

If {{company}} has something coming up, grab a time and we will go through it together. No pitch deck, no pressure:

[Book a time]

And if now is not the time, totally fine. The checklist is yours to keep.

Hi {{first_name}},

A vessel or marine asset waiting on registration and port requirements... sound familiar?

Start with this:

[Download the checklist]

Three things to check first:

1. Registration and port requirements
2. Large assets with complex handling
3. Spares for vessels in service

Skim it with your own shipment in mind. If something looks off, hit reply and send me the vessel or asset details. I will tell you what I would check first.

Hi {{first_name}},

Here is the one I always start with...

Are the registration and port requirements for this vessel or asset clear before it moves?

A "hmm, not sure" is common here. It is also where marine imports tends to get stuck.

Here is why it matters: MARINA and PPA requirements run alongside customs.

Heavy equipment and controlled materials mixed into one shipment, headed somewhere remote... sound familiar?

That is exactly what this checklist is for. Here it is:

Hi {{first_name}},

Before anything ships...

Are the controlled materials separated from the rest, and is the final delivery to site planned?

If your honest answer is "um... probably?", that is the part of mining imports where things tend to go sideways.

Here is why it matters: Explosives and reagents bring DENR, PNP-FEO and PDEA requirements.

Hi {{first_name}},

Solar and storage gear on a project clock, waiting on approvals... sound familiar?

So we put together a checklist for exactly that. Here you go:

[Download the checklist]

Three things to check first:

1. Incentives and approvals
2. Batteries and large components
3. Project delivery windows

Hi {{first_name}},

Okay, here goes...

Are the incentive approvals secured before the equipment arrives, and are batteries and large components planned for?

If you had to think about it, that is usually where renewable energy equipment imports starts to wobble.

Here is why it matters: DOE, BOI or PEZA treatment depends on documents prepared before arrival.

Hi {{first_name}},

Something I always ask first...

Do you know the rules for each product category in the shipment, including labels?

A "hmm, not sure" is common here. It is also where retail imports tends to get stuck.

Here is why it matters: FDA, DTI-BPS and NTC requirements can differ across items in one shipment.
